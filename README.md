## Library Management System
- Ideas: librarian would be able to manage books, visitors would book various books, also there would be stock management, notifications to return books, etc.

## Gym Management System
- Ideas: memberships (with or without payments), book facilities, enroll in group exercises, connect with trainers, and send reminders.
- Repository:

## School / Job Attendance System
- Ideas: basically, registering check-in and check-out events, with various reports and validation mechanisms.
- Repository:

## Job Board
- Ideas: employers register and post jobs, admins approve those ads, and candidates register and apply for the jobs - on the system, or just by getting the contact details.
- Repository:

## Simple Social Network
- Ideas: try to re-create your personal online space: Twitter, Facebook, or whichever you prefer. Of course, a very simplified version of it: posts, followers, timeline, likes/shares - that alone would be a good challenge.
- Repository:

## Doctor Appointment System
- Ideas: or, in fact, any appointments: beauty salon, car repair, you name it. There are employees with their work schedules, people can book the timeslots, and there should be a timetable calendar involved there somewhere.
- Repository:

## Simple E Shop
- Ideas: here, I would emphasize "simple", because real-life big e-commerce portals are hard to build, with all the details. But you can limit yourself with products and purchase them, with whatever payment provider you choose, with or without Laravel Cashier.
- Repository:

## Poll / Voting System
- Ideas: people could create polls, and get the links to send them to their friends, those friends would vote, and then the results could be shown in a chart, or exported to Excel for further calculations.
- Repository:

## To do List System
- Ideas: I guess I could have started with it at no.1, because it's by far the most popular idea for beginners. But I intentionally left it a bit later, so you would maybe favor something more challenging from above.
- Repository:

## Discussion Forum
- Ideas: anyone using forums these days? This was a popular idea a decade ago, but nowadays I'm not even sure people would be able to describe all the features of how forums work. But, you may try!
- Repository:

## Rental Booking System
- Ideas: in other words, a clone of Booking.com or Airbnb. Of course, a very simplified version, but still - you can manage properties, bookings, ratings, and reviews.
- Repository:

## Subscription Based SaaS
- Ideas: this is a tricky one because it involves payments and depends on your chosen payment providers or tools, the easiest would be to just purchase Laravel Spark. But still, to get a real job, you should probably have some experience with dealing with payments.
- Repository:

## Sports League System
- Ideas: if you're into sports, you can build a system to manage the teams, players, matches, scores, and standings. You may also build a public website with it.
